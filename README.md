This app allows you to make a todolist. Does this by creating a database for your todos. Each todo has an ID, a "name" in which is the actual todo, e.g. "Do the laundry", and a status: completed (which can be true or false). In the listview there are checkboxes to show if you've done a thing or not. By clicking on the item you can check (and uncheck) any item. By long clicking on the item you can delete it.
